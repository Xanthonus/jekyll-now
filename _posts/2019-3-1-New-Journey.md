title: After a long while Im back!
---

After a long year of working pretty hard I've decided I need to take some time to myself. I asked my current employer for a 2-month sabbatical to work on things I wanted to work on and get back to where I want to be. In doing this, I have a lot planned and will start my journey tomorrow in San Francisco, CA. I'm really excited to start this journey and meet lots of great people along the way. This Sunday and Monday I'll be at BSidesSF! Iâ€™m super excited to see and meet the hacker community in the area. My goal is to write a blog post every day of my journey.
