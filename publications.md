[Intel SGX: The Next Generation of Security](https://github.com/Xanthonus/SGX-Research/blob/master/kww_intelsgx-final.pdf?raw=true)  

Computer security is an ongoing threat to users around the world. Intel has created a new, innovative way of securing personal and identifiable information using extra processor instructions called Software Guard Extension or (SGX). Intel SGX enables applications to execute code and protect sensitive data from within the protected enclave giving developers direct control over application security. This protection is accomplished by several different cryptographic schemes that are detailed throughout this paper. This paper also presents the use cases of Intel SGX. What attack surfaces may be achievable and how the enclave may have the potential to leak information. I also present SGX pitfalls and how Intel might be able to improve them. Finally, the paper gives insight into Intel CET technology and how it will revolutionize application security with the protection of return oriented programming.
